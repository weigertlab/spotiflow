We will use the `synth_3d` dataset (corresponding to `synthetic-3d` in the paper, which is a good starting point if you want to then fine-tune on your own data). If you have your own annotated data, you can load it and store it in six different variables corresponding to the training images and spots, to the validation images and spots and to the test images and spots. You can use the `load_data()` function to that end (please [see the docs](https://weigertlab.github.io/spotiflow) to check the data format that the function allows)."
